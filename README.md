# etch-a-sketch

This is a implementation "of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch", as stated
in TOP's specification for the project.

Unfortunately, I dig into the project as soon as I read the specs and forgot to write this
README before everything else, so I'm writing it with the project done (September, 5, 2021).

This one makes me particularly proud of, because:
- My first feeling was that it would be very
hard to implement, but it was just hard :)
- I managed to make it so much prettier than the rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock
- I had to search often both about JS and CSS functions, properties, methods etc.

In every project so far, people at TOP's discord server were very helpful and thoughtful.
I thank particuarly "Rip Asstley" for helping me to figure out what was the performance issue
I had to recreate the pad from the user's imput.
